## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Responsive
- JS
- README.md file

### What I learned

I learned about &apos and other & signs in html, how to copy something to clipboard by pressing a button, and I practiced styling, making a aresponsive design and effective html.

```html
&apos
```
```css
header:nth-child(2):focus, header:focus-within > nav, header {
  height: auto;
  transform: scale(1);
}
```
```js
navigator.clipboard.writeText("Hello World");
```

### Continued development

For the future, I want to practice using APIs more, get better at JS, learn to use a framework like react, tailwind, angular or vue.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_copy_clipboard.asp) - This helped me how to copy something to clipboard by pressing a button. In general this w3s site is very useful for any programing languege that is has I recomend it to anyone starting learning a new languege.
